Description:
Dear user, there are several packages in this module for connecting and utilizing NCBI seven e-utilities. For your convinience I have also included seven PERL programs also for the same. Please install all the programs in your current directory and start working. You can include these basic programs, by extending this interface, to develop complex workflows. To the best of my knowledge they are working well as still under beta-testing.Even you need not to make or install these ready to use packages. Just untar the file and without any hesitation, use them.
