Description:

Dear user, there are several packages in this module for connecting and utilizing NCBI's seven e-utilities.

NCBI, the National Center for Biotechnology Information, provides extensive information to the biologists carrying
out research in molecular biology area. The databases at NCBI provide complete and comprehensive information about 
genes, genome, proteins and several other biologcal relevent information. 

Traditionally, the users use the GUI web based interface provided by the NCBI server to search and retrieve the data
from the database. But it had few limitations like you cannot visualize more than 20 results in the output therefore
to carry out massive projects of download to build a new database you have to sit a long while or use FTP repository.

These packages developed by me access NCBI through command line interface and provides users with a very powerful 
interface to retrieve data. They utilize entrez E-Utilities to fetch and retrieve the data.  

For convinience of users I have also included seven PERL programs which complements the packages.

Please install all the programs in your current directory. You can include these basic programs, by extending 
this interface, to develop complex workflows. 

To the best of my knowledge they are working well as still under beta-testing.

These packages can be a very powerful tool to download the desired data from NCBI and soon I will develop
packages to download data from EMBL, another such repository utilizing SRS data.
